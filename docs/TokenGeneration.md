# Token Generation for agent

In order to use quicklog agent, you must have agent token which can be created using the dashboard.

If you are using the self hosted one, you can view dashboard on `http://localhost:7000` or if you are using hosted version, you can directly go to https://app.quicklog.dev to create an agent.

### Step 1

Login to your account and create agent by clicking Add Agent button on the right corner.
